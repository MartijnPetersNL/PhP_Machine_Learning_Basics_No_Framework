    <h2>Infographics: What is a outlier in data?</h2>
    <p>An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. Outliers may indicate variability in the measurement or may be due to experimental errors; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.</p>
    <img src="images/datascience_outlier.png" alt="Infographic explaining outliers" class="infographic">
    <img src="images/clustering-outliers.png" alt="Graph explaining clustering outliers" class="infographic">
    <p>Outliers can skew and mislead the interpretation of results of statistical analyses.</p>
    <p> What are <strong>common causes of outliers?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measurement error: inaccuracies in data collection can lead to outliers.</li>
        <li>Data entry error: mistakes made while inputting data can create outliers.</li>
        <li>Natural variability: some data points may be extreme but valid observations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> What are <strong>uncommon causes of outliers?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Novelty: new and unique events may not fit existing patterns.</li>
        <li>Contextual factors: changes in the environment can affect data collection.</li>
        <li>Intentional manipulation: data may be altered to achieve a desired outcome, such as manually adding data points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Note: Intentional manipulation of data is unethical and can lead to significant consequences in research and business.</p>
    <p> Specific intentional manipulation can lead to jurisdictional issues and legal consequences.</p>

    <h2> Infographics: "normal" programs vs AI programs deel 1</h2>
    <p> AI programs are designed to give probabilistic outputs: they can handle uncertainty and provide results that reflect the likelihood of different outcomes.</p>
    <p> "normal" programs, on the other hand, are deterministic: they produce the same output for a given input every time. </p>
    <img src="images/normal_program_vs_ai_program.jpg" alt="Infographic explaining normal programs vs AI programs" class="infographic">
    <p> AI programs are like a brain, but in machine form. They can learn from data, adapt to new information, and improve their performance over time.</p>
    <p> Below a GIF that explains the basics of machine learning: the AI program is like a brain but in machine form.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
       <img src="images/machine_learning_basics.gif" alt="Gif explaining machine learning basics" class="infographic">
    <img src="images/machinelearning_neural_network.png" alt="Neural Network Diagram" class="infographic">
    <img src="images/neural_networks_mind.gif" alt="animation how human mind start the AI tool creation">
    </div>
    <p> This means that AI programs have to co-exist with programs that are not AI, and they can be used together to create more robust applications.</p>
    <p> Because it would not make much sense to have a AI pocket calculator that only works with certain types of calculations, it is important to integrate AI capabilities into existing software systems.</p>
    <p> Implementing AI tools or scripts should be intentional, not just a "nice to have" feature.</p>
    <h2> Animation: How human labour is diffrent from AI</h2>

       <p> AI Tools and Copyright of products by users: </p>
       <p> AI tools can generate new content, but the copyright of that content can be complex. Users should be aware of the potential copyright implications when using AI tools to create or modify content.</p>
       <p> It is important for users to understand the terms of service and licensing agreements associated with the AI tools they use, as these can impact their rights to the generated content.</p>
       <p> Users should also be cautious about the data they input into AI tools, as this data can sometimes be used to train the underlying models and may have implications for privacy and ownership.</p>
       <p> So before using a AI tool, starting reading the terms of service until you understand what you can and cannot do with the output.</p>
       <p> It is also advisable to keep records of the input data and the generated output, as this can be useful in case of any disputes or questions about ownership when using AI tools for work.</p>
       <p> Below a Images of a protected IP character made with the assistance of AI:</p>
       <div class="image-container">
       <img src="images/mickey_mouse_aiart.png" alt="mickey mouse AI art" class="infographic">
       <img src="images/captain_marvel_aiart.jpg" alt="captain marvel AI art" class="infographic">
       <img src="images/minecraft_ai_art.png" alt="Minecraft AI art" class="infographic">

       <p> Luckily also the fair use act exist, which allows for the use of copyrighted material under certain conditions.</p>
       <p> These conditions are the following:</p>
       <ul>
           <li> 1.The use must be for a transformative purpose, such as commentary, criticism, or education.</li>
           <li> 2. The amount of copyrighted material used must be limited and not excessive.</li>
           <li> 3. The use must not negatively impact the market for the original work.</li>
       </ul>
       <p> the 2nd and 3rd conditions are very subjective and can be open to interpretation, which can lead to legal disputes.</p>
       <p> Disney has been known to aggressively protect its intellectual property, and this can create challenges for users of AI tools who want to incorporate copyrighted material into their work.</p>
       <p> So in general Copyright law is intentionally complex, to protect the rights of IP holders while also allowing for innovation and creativity under their terms of use.</p>

    <h2> Common AI tool misconceptions</h2>
    <p> Myth: ai tools came out of nowhere and are its own seperate program type </p>
    <p> Reality: AI tools are built on existing technologies and frameworks, and they require careful integration into existing systems.</p>
    <p> AI tools are a specialization in the field of machine learning, and they leverage advanced algorithms and data processing techniques to deliver insights and predictions.</p>
    <p> AI tools give good output when the input, the prompts set a clear context and expectations.</p>
    <p> Ask yourself as a AI tool user: can i summarize what i really want as output in a few sentences, wihtout sounding vague?</p>
    <p> AI tools are definetly not magic wands that can solve all problems without human intervention.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> Unlike humans, AI can not replicate the full range of human cognitive abilities, such as emotional intelligence, creativity, and ethical reasoning.</p>
    <p> A fair equivalant of machine labour is Robot arms in car factories, which can perform repetitive tasks with high precision and speed.</p>

    <p> Neither AI tools nor Robot arms can fully replace human workers, as they lack the ability to understand context, make complex decisions, and exhibit empathy.</p>
    <p> Therefore, AI will not replace human workers, but rather augment their capabilities and help them work more efficiently.</p>
    <p> In the short term that will mean the repetitive tasks will be automated, but in the long term it will mean that AI will be used to assist humans in their work even more.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3> Conclusion: critique the owner of the AI tools , not the users</h3>
    <p> It is important to hold the creators and implementers of AI tools accountable for their design and deployment, rather than blaming the end users who may not fully understand the technology.</p>
    <p> It is a tool after all, and like any tool, it can be used for both good and ill purposes.</p>
    <p> Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that AI tools are developed and used ethically, transparently, and responsibly.</p>
    <p> And to get a long term AI vision of a ideal future ask yourself: What kind of world do we want to create with AI? and how do we take steps to get there?</p>

         <h1> The long term planning summarized </h1>
    <img src="images/long-term-planning.png" alt="Long Term Planning">
    <p> The long term planning is to create a machine learning website that showcases my skill to employers when doing a interview.</p>
    <img src="images/portfolio-aspects.png" alt="Portfolio Aspects">
    <p> I also have a JavaScript react website online, but that website can not use PHP-ML learning tools.</p>
    <h3> The aspects of the portfolio are:</h3>
    <p> 1. Organize: placing the source code and files in a logical structure, one that is also understandable for potential collaborators.</p>
    <p> 2. Document/Archive: providing clear and concise documentation for all code and tools used in the project.</p>
    <p> 3. Showcase: creating a visually appealing and informative website to demonstrate the project's capabilities.</p>
    <p> 4. Socialize: allow other developers to contribute to the project, fostering a community around the php_ML project.</p>
    <p> 5. Reflect: reflect on the project's progress and identify areas for improvement, according to a consistent vision.</p>
    <p> 6. Publish: publish the project on GitHub and other platforms to reach a wider audience.</p>

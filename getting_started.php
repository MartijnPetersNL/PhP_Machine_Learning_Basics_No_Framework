    <h1>Getting Started with PHP-ML</h1>
    <p>PHP-ML is a library for machine learning in PHP. This guide will help you get started with using PHP-ML in your projects.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To install PHP-ML, you can use Composer:</p>
    <pre><code>composer require php-ai/php-ml</code></pre>
    <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple example of using PHP-ML:</p>
    <pre><code>use Phpml\Classification\KNearestNeighbors;

$classifier = new KNearestNeighbors();
$classifier->train($samples, $labels);
$predictedLabel = $classifier->predict($newSample);</code></pre>

<h1> Step 1: Collecting data for your model </h1>
<p>Before you can train a machine learning model, you need to collect and prepare your data. This involves gathering relevant data points, cleaning the data, and formatting it in a way that can be used by the model.</p>
<p> Below a form to showcase how a form can be use to collect data that is useful for a model. </p>
<form>
    <h2>Data Collection Form</h2>
    <label for="feature1">Feature 1: height</label>
    <input type="text" id="feature1" name="feature1"><br>
     <label for="feature2">Feature 2: weight</label>
    <input type="text" id="feature2" name="feature2"><br>
    <label for="feature3">Feature 3: age</label>
    <input type="text" id="feature3" name="feature3"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<h1> Step 2: sanitizing your data </h1>
<p> Data sanitization means cleaning and organizing your data to ensure its quality and consistency. This process involves removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values.</p>
<p> This could also include removing outliers, which are data points that differ significantly from other observations and can skew the results of your analysis.</p>
<p> This step is crucial for ensuring that your model is trained on high-quality data, which can lead to better performance and more accurate predictions.</p>

<h1> Step 3: training your model </h1>
<p> Once your data is prepared, you can use it to train a machine learning model. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, feeding the training data into the model, and allowing it to learn from the data.</p>
<p> When choosing a model ask yourself of the team: what is the goal of the model? What kind of data do we have? How much data do we have? What is the expected output?</p>
<p> Will it run on a local computer, which usually has limited resources, or will it run on a server with more processing power?</p>

<h1> Step 4: evaluating your model </h1>
<p> After training your model, it's important to evaluate its performance. This involves testing the model on unseen data and measuring its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.</p>
<p> if the model does not perform well, consider using a different model from the same library.</p>

<p> Step 5: deploying your model </h1>
<p> Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can deploy it to a production environment. This involves integrating the model into your application and making it available for use.</p>
